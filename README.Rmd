The goal of elm is to provide a file size exploration tool that allows you to visualize 
  multiple files on your computer in an interactive way using R. With elm, you can 
  view your files by size in a variety of different ways, including a treemap (by size and file type), sunburst chart, and a directory tree. Elm makes it easy to gain insights into the files on your computer, helping you to manage your storage more effectively.

## Installation

You can install the development version of elm like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("parmsam/elm")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(elm)
```

## Interactive plots
You can visualize your folders or files as a treemap using the `elm_treemap_*()` functions:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
elm_treemap_folders()
elm_treemap_files()
```

## Static plots
Alternatively, you can set interactive to FALSE to get static versions for some of the plots.
```{r, out.width = "350px"}
elm_treemap_folders(interactive = FALSE)
elm_treemap_files(interactive = FALSE)
```

## Directory tree
Here's an example of how you can print and copy the folders in your current directory in a tree-like format using `elm_clip_folders()` (note that the file size isn't included here).
```{r}
elm_clip_folders()
```
Or you can use `elm_clip_files()` to print and copy the files in your current directory in a tree-line format (note that the file size isn't included here).
```{r, eval=FALSE}
elm_clip_files()
```
